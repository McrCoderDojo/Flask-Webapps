You'll need several programs/modules for this workshop:

* Python 2 (Preferably 2.7, but any 2.x should work)
* Flask
* SQLAlchemy
* Flask-SQLAlchemy (An extension package for Flask that makes SQLAlchemy easier to use)

For Windows, I recommend using ActivePython, as it includes easyinstall and pip

http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads

Most (if not all) Unix based systems (e.g. Linux & Mac OS X) will have python installed,
or available through the package manager (but you may need to install pip separately.
Some package managers may also have Flask, SQLAlchemy and Flask-SQLAlchemy.

Once you have pip you can run

    # pip install flask-sqlalchemy

to install everything you need.

Alternatively, you can download each of the packages individually from the following websites:

* http://www.python.org/download/
* http://flask.pocoo.org/
* http://www.sqlalchemy.org/
* https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-SQLAlchemy
